# meeting 2024-07-09

* nuno is working on physical pointers, might help with inttoptr confusion
* originally lifted to alive, but needed bespoke optimisation passes
* john needs to build aslp
* worst thing: spec successes < 25%. alive doesn't support "invoke"
* fuzzer: mutations of llvm functions. alternative generation-based fuzzer, less powerful.
* aslp section in regehr's paper:
  * two ways to lift instructions
  * costs of using auto-generated lifter?
  * engineering problem
  * how much domain knowledge (in writing hand-written lifters) can be integrated with auto-generated lifters?
  * are optimisations too domain-specific? i.e. specific to alive?
  * should be well-fit within paper. explore trade-offs
  * instruction-specific fixes or systematic fixes
    * power of 2 widths
    * vectoriser
    * slicing, concat
* nuno working on memory model section in paper

* regehr on sail and isar: alasdair armstrong. each instruction would be more work than manual approach

* get to bottom of performance issues: are there a few root causes or millions of cuts?
